# Mini-Music-Synthesizer
The synthesizer was coded using C language. The code shows use of data structure like binary tree and also showcases the use of pointers effectively. Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm is used which simulates the physical behaviour of the sound-producing components of a musical instrument. On running the program it produces a .wav file which runs on any Operating System. The output files dusty.wav and stairway.wav are some examples of the output produced by the program. There is a list of frequencies provided to the user which could be used to create their own music.
